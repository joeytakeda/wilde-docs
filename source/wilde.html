                <p>The Wilde Trials International Archiveis a textbase and
                    text-­sharing detection program for analyzing international news
                    reports about the three trials of Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s three trials
                    were an international media event in the spring of 1895 and were
                    front­-page news the world over for nearly a two­ month period,
                    triggering debates about homosexuality, censorship and press
                    standards. The textbase contains news reports published
                    in1895 which have been gathered from newspapers around the
                    world in a number of languages.</p>

                <h3>Page: Browsing the Reports</h3>
                <p>On the Reports page, you will find a bar graph showing the
                    day-by-day volume of news on the Wilde trials across all four
                    languages represented in the archive,and a full list of all
                    news reports collected on the three trials of Oscar Wilde.</p>
                <p>The bar graph features a legend in the corner that indicates
                    which color represents the language in which the reports were
                    published. The graph offers two data visualization displays. The
                    default display is Stacked, with the line indicating the total
                    number of reports for each day and the colours differentiating each
                    language. Choose Grouped to separate the number of reports in each
                    language per day into separate lines. In either view, hover over a
                    line to view the exact number of reports in each language for each
                    day.</p>
                <p>News reports on Wilde’s trials can be browsed by date,
                    newspaper, region, city, and languagevia the drop-down
                    filtersaboveeach field. To reset the list, return the
                    drop-down filtersto blank.</p>
                <p>The search bar on the upper right hand side of the list will
                    query theNewspaper, Region, City, and Language fields. (For
                    example, you can search by “Gazette” to find all reports published
                    in newspapers with Gazette in the title; or you can search by
                    “Britain” to find all reports published in Britain).</p>
                <p>The metadata for the Reports includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date: the publication date of the report</li>
                    <li>Newspaper: the name of the newspaper in which the report
                        was published</li>
                    <li>Region: the country in which the newspaper was published</li>
                    <li>City: the city in which the newspaper was published</li>
                    <li>Language: the language in which the report was first
                        published</li>
                    <li>Document Matches: the number of other full reports that match,
                        based on the measure of Levenshtein distance.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph Matches: the number of other paragraphs in other
                        reports that match, based on the measure of Levenshtein
                        distance.</li>

                <h3>Page: Individual reports</h3>
                <p>Each report provides two different kinds of matching tools. The
                    main section shows in-line matches, which are matches that are
                    found at the paragraph level. The second comparison section, on the
                    right-hand side, shows document matches, which are matches that are
                    found at the full document level.</p>
                <p>Each individual news report also includes basic bibliographic
                    metadata about the newspaper from which it was derived, as well as
                    date of publication, word count, and source information. If sourced
                    from open-access databases, a link to the facsimile is provided. In
                    the case of certain databases, however, it is not possible to
                    provide a direct link to the report.</p>
                <p>Metadata for each individual report includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Newspaper: the name of the newspaper in which the report was
                        published</li>
                    <li>Date published: the publication date of the report</li>
                    <li>Region: the country and city in which the newspaper was
                        published</li>

                        published</li>
                    <li>Sources: the database and institution where the newspaper is
                        located, including links</li>
                    <li>Facsimile: link to the digitized copy of the report</li>
                    <li>Word count: the number of words in the report</li>
                </ul>
                
                <section>
                    <h4>In-line matches</h4>
                    <p>The in-line match section will be shown first in the language in
                        which it was originally published. For non-English languages, a
                        translation in English can be found by selecting the “English” tab.
                        Matches may be found in either the original or translated
                        language.</p>
                    <p>Each paragraph from the individual report that matches a
                        paragraph in another report will appear with a match button next to
                        it. The match button will indicate how many matches of that
                        paragraph have been found.</p>
                    <p>Selecting the match button will display the matches of each
                        paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Selecting Compare Paragraphs will open a new page that compares
                        the two reports at the paragraph level. The page displays the
                        original paragraph(s) on the left, and the matching paragraph(s) in
                        the middle. The column on the right highlights any differences
                        between the two matching paragraphs: pink shows differences in the
                        first report and purple in the second report.</p>
                    <p>Selecting Compare Documents will open a new page that compares
                        the two reports at the document level. The page displays the
                        original document on the left, and the matching document in the
                        middle. The column on the right highlights any differences between
                        the two matching documents: pink shows differences in the first
                        report and purple in the second report.</p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Document Matches:</h4>
                    <p>To the right of the in-line comparison tool is the document
                        comparison tool. The tool lists the names of each report that
                        matches the original report at the document level, and the
                        percentage of text-matching between documents. It also includes a
                        link to a document comparison tool. Selecting Compare Documents
                        will open a new page that compares the two reports at the document
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Levenshtein matches indicate reports that match based
                        onthe number of different characters between two pieces of
                        text.</p>
                    <p>Selecting the news report title will take you to the individual
                        record for that report.</p>
                    <p>Selecting the Compare tool will open a new page that compares
                        the two reports at the document level. The page displays the
                        original document on the left, and the matching document in the
                        middle. The column on the right highlights any differences between
                        the two matching documents: pink shows differences in the first
                        report and purple in the second report.</p>

                <h3>Page: Comparing the Reports</h3>
                <p>The compare tool allows comparison of passages from any two news
                    reports from the collection.</p>
                <p>To compare two different pieces of text, enter them into the two
                    fields below by copy and paste, and then select the Measure
                    button.The text-comparison tool will produce text similarity
                    scores based on levenshtein and cosine measures and highlight the
                    differences between the two texts.</p>

                <h3>Page: News Networks</h3>
                <p>These network graphs draw on matching reports data generated
                    within the archive to visualise news flows about the Wilde
                    trials.</p>
                <p>Select the “Newspapers Networks Gephi” link to see the reports
                    network visualization.</p>
                <p>Each newspaper forms a node in the network, indicated by a dot
                    on the graph. Newspapers are connected - or networked - to each
                    other based on whether documents or paragraphs from them match. For
                    example, if the New York Heraldhas any matches with the
                    Philadelphia Times, they are networked or connected. Selecting a
                    newspaper node will bring up metadata about its place in the
                    network.</p>
