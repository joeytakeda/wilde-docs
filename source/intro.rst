Introduction
============

The Wilde Trials International Archive is a textbase and text-­sharing detection program for analyzing international news reports about the three “gross indecency” trials of Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s three trials were an international media event in 1895 and were front­-page news the world over for nearly a two­ month period, triggering debates about homosexuality, censorship and press standards. The textbase contains news reports printed between April and May 1895 which have been gathered from newspapers around the world in a number of languages. 

The Wilde Trials Web App currently contains over 1,100 separate news
reports on the Wilde trials that have been gathered from British,
French, American, and Australian newspapers, in both English and
French languages. The gathered reports are from full­runs of these
regions’ newspaper coverage on the Wilde trials from April and
May, 1895.

National digitization projects, such as `Trove`_, `Europeana`_, and `Gallica`_,
have been instrumental in this curation process, as have newspapers
digitized by `Gale-Cengage`_ and other commercial providers. The reports
we have gathered are from full-runs of these regions’ newspaper
coverage on the Wilde trials from April and May, 1895, and they have
been transformed into text files and double corrected by a research
team.
